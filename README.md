# Brazilian Nut News

This is a companion project to my [YouTube Series on Building a Full Stack Application with RedwoodJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr92RcUMngc&list=PLrz61zkUHJJFzXe0xZ55RdAF3o3PGhd0U).

## Project Overview

We'll be building the "Brazilian Nut News," a Hacker News Clone.

- Users will see a weighted list of shared links
- Users will see a list of the latest shared links
- Each link will have it's own dedicated page, where users can comment on the link
- Users will be able to submit a link
- Users can sign up / login / logout
- Every user will have their own profile page where you can see links they shared, links they've marked as their favorites, comments they've made on other links
- Users can edit their profile

This video introduces the multi-part YouTube series. I give a brief overview of RedwoodJS, a full-stack React framework. And the tech stack: React, GraphQL, Apollo, Storybook, Prisma, TypeScript, and Jest.

I also give a brief project overview, demonstrating what we'll be building.

### Part 2: Installing Redwood / Setup / Tooling

- [On YouTube](https://youtu.be/lR8qwNFI5Z8)
- On Hashnode (if you prefer text) - coming soon

In this video, let's talk about tools and prerequisites for our RedwoodJS full-stack application. Together, we'll walk through every step from installation to the first run. Plus, I've got some pro tips on tools and extensions that will make your coding experience silky smooth.

### Part 3: Folder Structure

- [On YouTube](https://youtu.be/tJd2Db6y8tw)
- On Hashnode (if you prefer text) - coming soon

In this video, we'll explore the file and folder structure within RedwoodJS. We dive into Redwood's unique features, contrasting it with other frameworks like Next and Remix. Explore the API folder, backend configuration with Prisma, and serverless functions setup. On the backend, we'll briefly look at the functions, GraphQL, and lib directories, and delve into the services directory for GraphQL resolvers. On the front end, we'll look at how Redwood manages routes with their distinctive approach.

### Part 4: Redwood Generators / Stubbing out Pages, Components, and Layouts

- [On YouTube](https://youtu.be/vnBij3YzOpI)
- On Hashnode (if you prefer text) - coming soon

Here, we look at maximizing your efficiency as a developer through the use of RedwoodJS's generators. Out of the box, Redwood comes with 16 different generators that speed up and automate the process of creating components, layouts, and pages.
