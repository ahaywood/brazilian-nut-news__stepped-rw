# Brazilian Nut News

This is a companion project to my [YouTube Series on Building a Full Stack Application with RedwoodJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr92RcUMngc&list=PLrz61zkUHJJFzXe0xZ55RdAF3o3PGhd0U).

## Project Overview

We'll be building the "Brazilian Nut News," a Hacker News Clone.

- Users will see a weighted list of shared links
- Users will see a list of the latest shared links
- Each link will have it's own dedicated page, where users can comment on the link
- Users will be able to submit a link
- Users can sign up / login / logout
- Every user will have their own profile page where you can see links they shared, links they've marked as their favorites, comments they've made on other links
- Users can edit their profile
